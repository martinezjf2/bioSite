                    <p>Rosali has been a great father that has had to sacrifice a lot of his desires so that his family could live better. He is characterized as one of the most friendliest person, and very symphathetic. He has immigrated from El Salvador to begin a new journey and hope for a better future for his family. Knowing that it wasn't going to easy, he has successsfully started his first job in a pizzeria and saved enough money to bring his wife to this country as well. Both would work hard to earn enough money to bring their older son to this country for a better education. Due to his sacrifices and hard work, he has been rewarded many awards from his sons and daughters. He was introduced as a grandfather and was extremely happy to see his nephews and nieces! </p>
