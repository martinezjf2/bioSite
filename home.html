                    <p>Buying his first house with his wife was a huge achievement especially because they are a low-income family. Together they made about 60 - 70 thousand in one year. While Rosali was working a lot of hours in construction, his wife would work late night shifts at a strings factory to make sure to take care of her sons. The money he made was to save up for the house and rent, but the money she earned was for food and personal hygiene for the family.</p>
